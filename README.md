# Rock-vs-Mine-prediction-using-Sonar-data by Sathyanarayanan
Problem statement:
There is a war going on between two different countries namely A and B
We belong to country 'A'
We got an information like our opponent country 'B' is trying to fix explosive (technically called as Mines in this problem) under water.
Consider we have submarines, it is used to send and receive SONAR signals under water.
Our job is to predict whether the object beside the submarine is a Mine or a Rock using the signals sent by the Submarines.
The Dataset that we gonna use for this problem is Sonar data
It is clearly a Binary Classification problem.
Since Logistic regression is tailor made for Binary classification we gonna we Logistic regression for this problem.
Such an Intriguing problem to work on.
Lets have an euphoric learning experience working on this project.
